## Single View Metrology - Final Project for CS-2467 (Computer Vision)
In this project, I've implemented and evaluated two methods for making scene measurements using a single view of said scene, using a small set of evaluation image I have collected.

**Note: Evaluating "Single View Metrology in the Wild" was within the project scope as well, but the authors have not released any trained models**
